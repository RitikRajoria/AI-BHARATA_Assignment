##### Note:
 * The bottom bar navigation doesn't work because it wasn't necessary to show the working of it, only api call and creating a home page ui with own creativity is required.
 * Api call doesn't had any data related to coin's icon and bar chart so i just used dummy data for them.
 * Bottom Navigation bar working is simple let me know if it needs to be added.
